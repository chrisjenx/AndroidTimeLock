AndroidTimeLock
===============

Will time lock a build and stop the user running it if its too old, useful for releasing dev builds.

== Usage ==
Include the source or include as a library project.

Call in your application onCreate method:
TimeLock.get(this).setEnabled(..).set...;
Set any params you need, these are stored between instances.
Sorted! One Week after the app expires it will fail to open.

Then in your BaseActivity call:
TimeLock.get(this).check();
This remembers any settings setup in your application onCreate call.

== Version ==
- 1.0 initial version - very basic only supports dialog
